The distribution of first-step mutant growth rates given 2-step rescue under three mutation rates.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{FigureS3.eps}
\caption{
(\textbf{A}) One-dimensional slices of multidimensional platykurtic (dashed; semicircle), normal (solid; as used in main text), and leptokurtic (dotted; Laplace) mutational distributions with the same (co)variance but varying kurtosis.
(\textbf{B},\textbf{C}) The probability of 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-step rescue with platykurtic and leptokurtic mutational distributions, respectively.
The dots and broken lines represent simulation results ($10^5$ replicates for each wildtype growth rate).
The solid lines are the numerical results for the normal mutational distribution (as in Figure 3).
Parameters: $N_0=10^4$, $U=2\times 10^{-3}$, $n=4$, $\lambda=0.005$, $m_{max}=0.5$.

\caption{
The distribution of growth rates among rescue genotypes under 1-step (blue) and 2-step (red) rescue with (\textbf{A}) platykurtic and (\textbf{B}) leptokurtic mutational distributions (see Figure \ref{fig:lepto_platy_prob}A).
The solid lines are predictions for a normal mutational distribution (as in Figure 6).
The histograms show the distribution of growth rates among rescue genotypes observed across $10^5$ replicate simulations.
Parameters: $N_0=10^4$, $U=2\times 10^{-3}$, $n=4$, $\lambda=0.005$, $m_{max}=0.5$, $m_0=-0.1$.

The distribution of growth rates among first-step mutations that lead to 2-step rescue with (\textbf{A}) platykurtic and (\textbf{B}) leptokurtic mutational distributions (see Figure \ref{fig:lepto_platy_prob}A).
The curves and shadings are predictions for a normal mutational distribution (as in Figure 7).
The histograms show the distribution of growth rates observed across $10^5$ replicate simulations.
